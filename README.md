This project implements an error recommendation system using a recommendation engine based on user data. It generates error categories for users and provides an API endpoint to fetch the top n errors for a given user.

Steps Involved
Generating Data: We generate user profiles using a random method in JSON format. These profiles are then stored in a CSV file (user_profiles.csv).
Recommendation System: The system recommends errors based on a userâ€™s past error data, including error category, sub-category, and frequency.
API Endpoint: We have created an endpoint using Flask, where users can query their errors by user_id and retrieve the top n errors based on frequency.

File Descriptions
1. Reccomendation_system.ipynb
This notebook generates random user profiles in JSON format, which are saved as user_profiles.csv.
Each user has error categories such as Grammar, Vocabulary, Pronunciation, and Fluency along with sub-categories and frequencies.
2. user_profiles.csv
A CSV file containing user data generated by the notebook. Each row represents a user's error profile.
3. app.py
A Flask-based web application that reads from user_profiles.csv.
It provides an API to fetch error recommendations for a user based on their historical error patterns.

API Usage
1. Home Route
GET /
This renders a simple HTML form for inputting user_id and the number of recommended errors (n).
2. Generate Error Recommendations
POST /generate-exercise

Parameters:

user_id: ID of the user.
n: The number of top error recommendations to return (default is 3).

Running the Project
Ensure you have the necessary libraries:
pip install pandas flask
Run the Flask app:
python app.py
The app will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You can use the HTML form or make POST requests to the /generate-exercise endpoint.
